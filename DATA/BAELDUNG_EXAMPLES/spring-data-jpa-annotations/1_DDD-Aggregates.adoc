= 1ST PROJECT: DDD Aggregates and @DomainEvents

it has 'step-by-step' logic, simplifying code from first aggregator - Aggregate1 to Aggregate3

*The scenario is:*
create aggregate, save it and publish an event.

1) Using Aggregate1 instance via DomainService(using repository and publisher in @Transactional method)
You can publish event only in spring component transactional method!

2) Aggregate2 contains @DomainEvents collection<DomainEvent>. 

When save aggregate all the events in the collection will be publish automatically. After that the collection will be cleaned.

3) Using AbstractAggregateRoot

org.springframework.data.domain.AbstractAggregateRoot

Aggregate3 extends AbstractAggregateRoot<Aggregate3>
