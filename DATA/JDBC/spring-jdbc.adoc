== Bare Spring Projects

=== simple-jdbc

it's really simple project

=== ext-jdbc

it's quite interesting project with:

* rich dao implementation

* tests

* using property file in configuration

* choice between two data sources:

** hikary-postgres data source with connection pool management

** h2 in-memory data source with initiation sql script

* even transaction management! (you can see how the method has no result if: 1) the data source has auto-commit set false 2) the methods are not transactional)


=== data-jdbc

it's only started.. see sboot-data-jdbc project for example
